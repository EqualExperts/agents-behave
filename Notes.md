- The use of Langchain is a bit controversial. It is a very powerful tool, but it is a bit complicated to use. You also have that strange feeling of using a blackbox and not knowing exactly what is happening inside.
However, it is a great tool to quickly prototype and test ideas. The LangSmith tool is also great to understand what is happening inside the LLMs.

- Complex function calling for non openai models is still not perfect.

- GPT is an assistant, and it too smart. It's very hard to make him act as a user. It's like talking to a very smart person that is always trying to help you. It's not a good user experience.

- The LLMUser can fail too
